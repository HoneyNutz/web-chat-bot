### **Page 1: Introduction - The Builder and the Optimizer**

My name is Alexander DiCaprio, and my professional and personal life has been guided by two intertwined philosophies: the innate drive to **build** and the relentless passion to **optimize**. This dual identity is the common thread that runs through a career spanning massive aerospace corporations, strategic consulting firms, nimble startups, and the highest levels of the U.S. government. It is a journey defined by a refusal to accept inefficiency and a constant search for a smarter, cleaner, and more effective way to solve complex problems.

At my core, I am a systems thinker. I am drawn to the challenge of understanding the intricate components of a process, identifying its points of friction, and re-engineering it to function with elegance and purpose. I am not motivated by the pursuit of authority, but by the opportunity to **influence process for the better**. My greatest professional satisfaction comes from empowering people with the tools and systems they need to do their best work, saving them time and enabling them to focus on what truly matters.

This document tells the story of that journey. It is the story of a career path that was not always linear but was always guided by a desire to learn, to create, and to leave every system, team, and organization more capable than I found it. From automating manual workflows on a factory floor to architecting AI platforms for global diplomacy, this is the story of a builder and an optimizer.

### **Page 2: Forging a Foundation at Boeing**

My career began at the heart of American manufacturing, The Boeing Company, where I worked as a Budget and Planning analyst on the V-22 Osprey program. It was a trial by fire in a world of immense scale and complexity, and it was here that I first discovered my passion for process improvement.

I was immediately struck by the sheer weight of the bureaucracy. The most glaring inefficiency was our change-approval process, which required analysts to physically walk a piece of paper around to collect signatures from managers in finance, engineering, and manufacturing. It was a colossal waste of time. During a town hall with Boeing’s CFO, I seized an opportunity and raised my hand, pointing out this systemic bottleneck. To my surprise, my leadership tasked me with leading the solution. I designed and implemented a simple digital signature workflow that **saved over $75,000 in labor costs in its first year** and began to spread to other departments. It was a formative lesson in the power of a single person to effect meaningful change.

Later in a different role, I was responsible for tracking material costs for the V-22, a task that involved manually reconciling millions of data points from disparate spreadsheets and accounting systems. The process took weeks. I taught myself how to use Microsoft Access and built a database that ingested and cross-referenced all the data automatically. This innovation transformed the job from **weeks of tedious research into hours of focused analysis**, making our accounting more transparent and our team vastly more efficient. My time at Boeing forged my core belief that no process is too entrenched to be improved.

### **Page 3: The Pivot to IT at Booz Allen Hamilton**

After my foundational experience at Boeing, I joined Booz Allen Hamilton, initially in a similar role focused on Earned Value Management and scheduling. However, I knew my passion lay in technology and project management. I actively engaged with my leadership, persistently advocating for a transition into the IT practice.

My opportunity came when I landed a position as an **IT Project Manager** on a high-profile data analytics project for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) headquarters. This role was a turning point. It was my first formal immersion into the world of Agile development, and I was responsible for managing the development of critical Business Intelligence dashboards using technologies like Oracle Business Intelligence (OBI) and Microsoft Dynamics.

The central challenge was that I was stepping into a field where I had immense interest but no direct experience. I had to learn on the fly, rapidly absorbing the principles of Agile, the intricacies of the technology stack, and the complex needs of a major federal client. I successfully navigated this steep learning curve, guiding the team to deliver valuable analytical tools for the agency.

This project was the critical bridge in my career. It was the first time I was able to formally tie together my experience in data analytics, my interest in leadership, and my passion for technology-driven solutions. My time at Booz Allen was a lesson in proactive career management, proving that with persistence and a willingness to learn, I could steer my professional life in the direction of my passions and build a new foundation for my future.

### **Page 4: The Entrepreneurial Leap to MetaPhase**

After gaining invaluable experience at large, established firms like Boeing and Booz Allen, I made the most significant calculated risk of my career: I left a stable position to join **MetaPhase Consulting**, a small startup with only a handful of employees. I was the 14th person to join the company. I took this leap because I knew that a small, agile business would provide an unparalleled opportunity for growth, allowing me to break free from a defined role and gain experience across the entire business lifecycle.

The risk paid off immediately. At MetaPhase, I wore multiple hats simultaneously. I was a **Program Manager**, an **IT Manager**, and a **Business Development Lead**. The small size of the company meant I was directly involved in everything from writing proposals and winning new work to managing client delivery and overseeing internal IT.

This dynamic environment was an incredible accelerator for my career. It forced me to be versatile, strategic, and hands-on in a way that larger organizations simply cannot accommodate. I learned how to build a business from the ground up, not just manage a project within one. This entrepreneurial experience was critical, teaching me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of seeing the big picture—from the initial client pitch to the final project deliverable. My time at MetaPhase was a testament to the power of betting on oneself and embracing the challenges of a growing organization.

### **Page 5: Driving Data Strategy at USCIS**

My multifaceted role at MetaPhase quickly led to a position of significant leadership and impact. I became the **Director of our work at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)**, where I was responsible for a rapidly growing portfolio of projects and a talented team of consultants.

In this role, I was able to leverage my business development and program management skills to secure over **$20 million in new work** and lead four different major engagements within the agency. My most formative and impactful project was supporting the newly formed Office of the Chief Data Officer (OCDO). As the primary partner for this nascent organization, I was at the forefront of establishing a data-driven culture at USCIS.

I led the team that supported the OCDO in developing the **first-ever Data Strategy for USCIS**, a foundational document that set the vision and roadmap for how the agency would manage, leverage, and secure its vast data assets. Following that, I was the primary developer of the first **USCIS Data Literacy Maturity Analysis**. This groundbreaking assessment evaluated the data skills and capabilities of the agency’s workforce, identifying key gaps and providing a strategic plan for upskilling employees.

This work was the culmination of my journey up to that point. It required a deep understanding of data analytics, strategic thinking, client management, and the ability to navigate a complex federal environment. It was an opportunity to not just optimize a single process, but to help shape the entire data culture of a vital government agency.

### **Page 6: A Strategic Return to Public Service**

My journey eventually led me to my current role as a **Product Manager at the U.S. State Department’s Center for Analytics**. This position allows me to synthesize all of my past experiences—from process optimization and IT project management to data strategy—in a mission-focused environment.

My primary initiative is the **“AI Funhouse,”** a Databricks platform designed to democratize access to data science and AI tools for Department employees worldwide. The challenge was twofold: diplomatic posts needed advanced analytic capabilities but were constrained by prohibitive software costs. The Funhouse was conceived as a centralized, cost-effective solution.

Through meticulous optimization, we have scaled the platform to support over **400 data scientists** at an effective annual cost of just **$25,000**—doubling our user capacity while reducing the projected cost by 75%. More importantly, we addressed the technical barrier to entry. Recognizing that not all users were expert coders, we developed a custom **Software Development Kit (SDK)** that simplifies complex Python and R functions into single, intuitive calls.

This innovation has transformed the Funhouse into a true force multiplier, empowering employees with little to no coding experience to build their own solutions. From automating data wrangling to performing complex predictive analysis, the platform is having a tangible impact on the Department's mission. This role represents the pinnacle of my work so far: building an efficient, scalable, and accessible technological ecosystem that empowers public servants to solve real-world problems.

### **Page 7: An Unconventional Academic Path**

My career has been built on a unique and deliberately interdisciplinary academic foundation. I began my studies at Case Western Reserve University as a Biology major, drawn to the elegant and efficient processes of living systems. However, I found myself constrained by the rigid, mathematical nature of some of the required coursework and realized my true passion was in understanding human systems.

This led me to pivot to a double major in **Economics and Child Psychology**. This combination gave me a powerful lens for viewing the world. Child Psychology provided a deep understanding of the drivers of human motivation and behavior, while Economics gave me the framework to understand how those individual behaviors aggregate to create large-scale, systemic effects. It was the study of the "butterfly effect" in human society.

Immediately following my undergraduate studies, I entered a five-year pilot program at Case Western’s Weatherhead School of Management, earning a **Master of Science in Management (MSM)**. This program integrated me with experienced MBA candidates, providing an accelerated and immersive education in the core pillars of business: finance, marketing, and strategy. This unique academic path—from hard science to social science to management—equipped me not with a single specialty, but with a versatile and holistic approach to problem-solving that has been invaluable throughout my career.

### **Page 8: The Philosophy of a Lifelong Builder**

Outside of my professional life, my core identity as a builder and tinkerer continues. My hobbies are not just pastimes; they are practical expressions of my desire to understand, create, and master new skills.

This drive is most evident in my home workshop, which has become a lab for technological exploration. I dove into **3D printing**, initially as a way to fix broken household items, but this quickly evolved into designing and fabricating my own creations. This led me to the world of FPV (First-Person View) drones, where I learned to design and print custom parts, which in turn taught me the practical skills of soldering and electronics. It is a self-perpetuating cycle of learning and application.

Inspired by my work wiring networks at U.S. embassies as an Eligible Family Member, I built my own **home network server**. I assembled a server rack and taught myself to deploy a Proxmox virtualization environment, creating a containerized personal cloud for my media.

These hobbies are not separate from my professional identity; they are a direct extension of it. They reflect a fundamental curiosity about how things work and a deep-seated belief in the power of hands-on creation. Whether it's a complex data strategy or a custom-printed drone part, the underlying motivation is the same: to build something functional, efficient, and well-designed.

### **Page 9: Forging Resilience in the Himalayas**

In addition to intellectual and technical challenges, I have always been drawn to pushing my physical and mental limits. The ultimate test of this was a grueling trek to **Everest Base Camp** and beyond, an adventure I undertook with my sister.

The mountain was an unforgiving teacher. I suffered from acute mountain sickness early on, a humbling reminder of the power of nature. Reaching Base Camp was a monumental achievement, but our journey was only half over. We chose to return via the more strenuous path through the **Gokyo Lakes**, which took us over the treacherous, moon-like landscape of the Ngozumpa glacier.

The glacier broke me. Near the end of the crossing, I collapsed, physically and mentally exhausted beyond any limit I had ever known. I had nothing left to give. In that moment of absolute depletion, a deeper reserve of will took over. I forced myself back to my feet and stumbled forward, nearly crying with relief when I finally reached the teahouse at Gokyo.

That experience was a profound lesson in resilience. It taught me that our perceived limits are often just suggestions and that true strength is discovered not in the absence of adversity, but in the act of taking one more step when your body has nothing left to give. This mindset—of pushing through extreme difficulty with focused determination—has been as critical to my professional success as any technical skill.

### **Page 10: Conclusion - A Unified Vision**

Looking back, my career has been a journey of synthesis. It has been about connecting a passion for technology with an understanding of human systems, bridging the gap between strategic vision and hands-on implementation, and finding the common thread between building a database, a business, and a resilient mindset.

From optimizing workflows at **Boeing** to embracing Agile IT at **Booz Allen**, from driving growth at the startup **MetaPhase** to shaping national data strategy at **USCIS**, and finally to building AI platforms at the **State Department**, each step has been a building block for the next. The core motivation has remained unchanged: to use technology and strategic thinking to create cleaner, more efficient, and more empowering systems.

My unconventional education provided the intellectual framework, my professional experiences provided the practical skills, and my personal challenges forged the resilience necessary to see complex projects through to completion.

Ultimately, my story is one of a builder who believes the best way to predict the future is to design it. It is a story of an optimizer who knows that even the most complex systems can be made better, one improvement at a time. My goal is to continue this work—to tackle new challenges, build new solutions, and leave a lasting, positive impact on the organizations and missions I serve.
